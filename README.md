# LiRE
LiRE is an algorithm designed to efficiently correct errors made by any given baseline compressed-sensing support recovery algorithm.  LiRE  takes  as  input  an estimatesin of the true supports of an $m$-sparse d-dimensional signal $x^2+y^2=z^2$ observed through n linear measurements, and outputs are fined support estimate sout of size m.
