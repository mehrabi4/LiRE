# LiRE
LiRE is an algorithm designed to efficiently correct errors made by any given baseline compressed-sensing support recovery algorithm.  LiRE  takes  as  input  an estimatesin of the true supports of an m-sparse d-dimensional signal x observed through n linear measurements, and outputs are fined support estimate s_{out} of size m.
